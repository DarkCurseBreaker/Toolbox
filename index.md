Repo that Stores Nails

## Nail Redux
You may have never heard of the asymmetric, competitive PvP called, Nail, but we have brought it back, looking, playing and running better than before! This version of the map is an attempt to hone the competitive, fast-paced, and multi-faceted gameplay of the original while applying some aesthetic and performance varnish to top it off.

## Features
- Most of the important game logic commands have been ported to .mcfunction files which are under the hammer namespace in the included _Omnitool_ data-pack. Now, ungodly amounts of TNT can be ignited without fear of breaking integral redstone lines.

- With the use of structure blocks, Nail finally has the replayability it always deserved! The function `hammer:post_game/reset` can be run manually by server operators to completely reset the map for another round! This can also be run through a clickable chat message that is broadcast at the end of a match.

- Improved performance. Chunks with command blocks needing to remain loaded on the LAN or dedicated server ae a thing of the past. Furthermore, block updates and lighting updates caused by redstone components are eliminated, thus improving performance! The improved performance on the map allows it to be run on lower end hardware. In fact I am able to run this map on my Raspberry Pi 4 with 6 players!

- Visual refresh. Nail has recieved a fresh coat of paint! Most of the new visuals have been built by [Ksargen](https://www.minecraftforum.net/members/Ksargen/posts)'s team in Russia (no affiliation) whose [Nail Reborn](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/maps/3037410-nail-reborn-1-16-pvp-minecraft-map-for-8-12) map ([Map Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/156OyrQ4g6y_yRRN8-tIwiz59RnxP-xkE/view)) we have utilised as a base for our remake. Credits to [TopTier Tater](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkujbF92OVn20eEgJgW1bAg) for aethetic additions such as jungle structures, castle nether theming, easter eggs, traps and an overall visual touch up.
